AWS created Control Tower as a way to allow organization to manage their AWS Organization, accounts and their setup. Control Tower has nice UI in AWS console, but if you try to terraform anything you will quickly get confused, because terraform (with AWS provider 5.62.0) has ONLY TWO aws_control_tower_* resources. Situation with awscli (version 2.17.5) isn&amp;rsquo;t much better.</description></item></channel></rss>
